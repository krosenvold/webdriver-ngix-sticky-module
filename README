Nginx Stiky Module 
--

Description:
	A nginx module to add a sticky cookie to be always forwarded the the same
	upstream server.

	When sticky module can't apply, it switchs back to classic the Round Robin
	Upstream.	Sticky module can't apply when :
		- cookies are not supported by the browser
		- a browser first connects
		- the upstream server choosed by the sticky module is in error

Installation

	You'll need to re-compile Nginx from source to include this module.
	Modify your compile of Nginx by adding the following directive
	(modified to suit your path of course):

	./configure --add-module=/absolute/path/to/sticky-nginx-module
	make
	make install

Usage
	upstream {
		sticky;
		server 127.0.0.1:9000;
		server 127.0.0.1:9001;
		server 127.0.0.1:9002;
	}

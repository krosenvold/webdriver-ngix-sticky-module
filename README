Nginx Stiky Module 
--

Description:
	A nginx module to add a sticky cookie to be always forwarded the the same
	upstream server.

	When dealing with several backend servers, it's sometimes useful that one
	client (browser) is always served by the same backend server
	(for session persistance for example).

	Using a persistance by IP (with the ip_hash upstream module) is maybe not
	a good idea because there could be situations where a lot of different
	browsers are coming with the same IP address (behind proxies)and the load
	balancing system won't be fair.

	Using a cookie to track the upstream server makes each browser unique.

	When the sticky module can't apply, it switchs back to classic the Round Robin
	Upstream.	Sticky module can't apply when :
		- cookies are not supported by the browser
		- a browser first connects
		- the upstream server choosed by the sticky module is in error

Installation

	You'll need to re-compile Nginx from source to include this module.
	Modify your compile of Nginx by adding the following directive
	(modified to suit your path of course):

	./configure --add-module=/absolute/path/to/nginx-sticky-module
	make
	make install

Usage
	upstream {
		sticky;
		server 127.0.0.1:9000;
		server 127.0.0.1:9001;
		server 127.0.0.1:9002;
	}

	sticky [name=route] [domain=.foo.bar] [path=/] [expires=1h];
	  - name:    the name of the cookies used to track the persistant upstream srv
		           Default: route
		- domain:  the domain in which the cookie will be valid
		           Default: nothing. Let the browser handle this.
		- path:    the path in which the cookie will be valid
		           Default: nothing. Let the browser handle this.
		- expires: the validity duration of the cookie
		           Default: nothing. It's a session cookie.
		           Restriction: must be a duration greater than one second
